# convex-hull (IntellijIDEA Project)
Due to the course "Algorithmische Geometrie" at my university I came in contact with the concept of [convex hull](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konvexe_H%C3%BClle).
Which is used in felds like collision detection.  
 
## Algorithms
There are different algorithm to calculate the convex hull of a cluster of points. In this program these points are coordinates in a two dimensional space. 

### First Algorithm O(n2)
### Divide & Conquer Algorithm O(n log(n))
### Graham's Scan O(n log(n))
### Merge & Graham's Scan O(n)
